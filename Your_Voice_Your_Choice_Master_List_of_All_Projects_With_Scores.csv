There are no sidewalks on our segment of Beacon Ave S, which children walk along daily to catch the school bus. Aside from the elicit reckless driving, there is a general speeding problem from drivers bypassing 51st Ave S by using our neighborhood street as an arterial. The steep grades on either side of S Bond Street aggravate poor speed regulation even by local access drivers, and traffic calming measures are sorely needed.    Doppler radar data collected over an eight day period on Beacon Ave S 100 feet north of S Bond Street showed an 85th percentile of 34MPH and a 99th percentile of 43MPH. This means that fully 15% of the drivers on our road during this period broke the speed limit by at least 9MPH and 1% by at least 18MPH. The maximum speed recorded was 47MPH!    We are united as a neighborhood in a legitimate fear of being struck by speeding drivers on Beacon Ave S.

Funded for 2018 Implementation,15,15,15,,17-461,,Crossing Improvements @ NE 55th & 30th Ave NE,"NE 55th St. is a difficult and dangerous street to cross. There are no marked crosswalks for a 9 block stretch (between 34th Ave NE and 25th Ave NE), despite an active retail area between 28th and 30th Ave. NE. This is a wide road with cars parked only intermittently, leading to fast traffic. Drivers rarely stop for people to cross the street. It has been the spot of at least one collision leading to serious injuries for a woman crossing the street (http://www.ravennabryant.org/2013/11/hit-and-run-on-ne-55th/). Hills and land use (such as Calvary Cemetery) make it even more challenging for people to access a safe crossing.     Crossing anywhere this stretch of NE 55th St. is a challenge, but this proposal focuses on improving the crossing at 30th Ave. NE. This is an important intersection because it is halfway between lights (at 25th and 35th Ave. NE). It is located in a retail core. Some think of it as the ""Queen Mary Crossing,"" and I can say that just this week when my aging mother in law took my 5 and 7 year old daughters to a tea party I was terrified thinking of them crossing here to get to the gift shop and again to the bus stop. This is on the edge of the cemetery, and is a prime corridor for people walking and biking to Bryant or beyond from U Village and the Burke Gilman trail. Parked cars make it challenging for people driving to see those waiting to cross, especially at the Z-shaped intersection of 30th Ave. NE, where people are attempting to cross from a sidewalk ramp hidden in between cars, rather than at a street corner. There are multiple preschools and child-centered businesses on or adjacent to NE 55th, and so parents commonly need to park on 55th and cross this busy street with young children. (Memorably, when my kids wanted to participate in Bike to School day at their school, we stood on the corner watching cars zoom by for minutes, and were finally only able to walk our bikes across the street when a stranger flagged down traffic and acted as an ad hoc crossing guard.) ","1) Curb Bulbs  There is already a curb ramp in front of Jack and Jerome at the intersection of NE 55th St. and 30th Ave NE, but anyone waiting to cross there is hidden by parked cars. I would like to see the two adjacent parking spots removed and the creation of a curb bulb. If this were implemented with a lower cost paint/barrier curb bulb, a design like teacups might be painted on to incorporate local character at the ""Queen Mary Crossing.""     2) Marked Crosswalks  Because many, especially those biking, cross on the east side of the intersection, two painted crosswalks at both the east and west side where 55th and 30th intersect are key to making this crossing successful.     3) Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacon  A RRFB that could be triggered from the sidewalk or by a person on a bike (heading north on 30th) could add another element of visibility.

We have had multiple collisions at this intersection that involve drivers crashing. The most recent collision required that the street be closed until well 1am due to the driver bringing down several power poles. The latest driver skillfully wedged themselves, after crashing of course, between the Senior Center and the bus stop.  (https://twitter.com/NoSpandexReq/status/826987301544669184). This is a major access point for so many ages and abilities. When the traffic pole is taken out the retiming for the pedestrians ends up at the shortest countdown for a very big street. ",This intersection could use a median that does not allow drivers to turn. Decrease the distance it takes for pedestrians to cross and narrow that section so it becomes uncomfortable for drivers to make dangerous decisions.

Additionally, the tennis courts do not have a hitting wall.  A hitting wall would allow youth tennis players the opportunity to practice on their own.","I asked Kathleen Conner from Seattle Parks and Recs for a quote on a water fountain and here is her response.  I spoke to Seattle Public Schools and they have said no to the water fountain on their property due to maintenance concerns.      Hi Irvin,    Yes, I got an estimate last week from Pam Alspaugh (see below).   To install a new drinking fountain on Parks property, the cost would be $54,000 (see the line on the aerial photo attached).  To install one on School District-owned property (see the circle on the attached aerial photo), it would cost about $5-10,000.  For the School District option, you would need to work with the School District because it is on their property.      From Pam Alspaugh, Seattle Parks and Recreation Senior Landscape Architect:    ""The best option for a drinking fountain at the tennis courts at Rainier Beach is where there previously was a drinking fountain adjacent to courts on the school property.  The location is circled on the attached photo.  This drinking fountain may have been removed when the school was remodeled.  It would be much less expensive to reinstall a drinking fountain in this location, because there is a water line and a sewer line.  This cost would be estimated at $5,000-$10,000, depending on whether the catch basis remains or if it was removed.    On Park property it looks like the nearest potable water line is about 250' away (solid line on the photo) and the nearest sanitary sewer (dashed line) is about 50' away from the NW corner of the tennis courts.  For a contractor to bid and construct the water and sewer lines, add the required catch basin, purchase and install the drinking fountain, and add associated paving I would estimate the cost would be a minimum of $34,000.  (Total project costs $54,000 with design, etc.)  It could be higher due to site conditions.  This assumes that the NW entry location is ADA accessible.""

Extrapolating this data from 110-140 cars in that hour, you get a daily traffic volume of 2,100 to 2,800 cars per day, which far exceeds what should be allowed for a residential street.     Speed of Cars    Due to the hill and the lack of stop signs, cars easily hit 30 mph or higher going up or down. The traffic circle and bump outs at the park do little to slow cars down. We were told by SDOT to use our own cars to park on either side of the street to create narrowing. My wife's car has been hit by cars with no note. During the rental of the radar gun mentioned above, we recorded cars going 5 mph or more above the speed limit to be 54%. Note this was done after the reduction of the speed limit to 20 mph in residential neighborhoods.     The speed of the cars could propose safety issues to pedestrians trying to cross 42nd Ave in Genesee Park. ","Proposed Projects    I would like to propose a speed/traffic volume study to be performed on 42nd Ave between Snowqualmie and Alaska halfway up the block midway to track the number of cars and max speeds of cars on this street. If the numbers are in line with the data shown below, additional action could be made by SDOT to improve the safety features of the street and to limit the number of cars using it as a bypass.     Proposed safety measures:  Install a three way stop sign at 42nd Ave S and Snoqualmie  Install speed humps through the bends at the park.  Install a barrier to prevent cars from moving on 42nd Ave past Alaska. This will allow cars to turn east onto Alaska to get into the neighborhood, but will prevent cars from using 42nd as the by-pass. In my opinion, this will be one of the only ways to deter cars from using 42nd as a by-pass.  Even if some of the projects cannot be incorporated with this program, I would hope that data showing un-safe driving conditions and car volumes that far exceed acceptable levels for residential streets would be addressed in some manner.

I've recorded an average of four cars per hour that either fail to stop at the intersection or apply brakes at the last minute, skidding to a halt in the middle of the intersection. Neighbors have recorded multiple instances of drivers nearly missing pedestrians at this location, either because they ignore the existing legal pedestrian crossing or fail to see the posted 4-way stop.   Drivers traveling north on 50th avenue regularly exceed the posted speed limit, risking injury to pedestrians crossing at this location and collision with vehicles traveling either eastbound or westbound on S. Angeline Street. The blinking red light is also very difficult to see when traveling northbound on 50th avenue because of the declined road grade.    I have personally seen multiple vehicular collisions at this intersection.    SPD officers regularly post on either side of Angeline St. at the intersection because the need only wait a few moments until someone ignores the blinking stop light at this location.    There is a park and playground (Lakewood Park) at the southeast corner of this intersection as well as a community center (Lakewood Seward Park Neighborhood Association) on the northwest corner.  Both locations receive a large amount of pedestrian traffic throughout the year, a majority of which are children walking to the park.

Both of these streets are very wide, with an overabundance of pavement, narrow sidewalks and a noticeable lack of tree canopy and green space. The former route of an historic electric trolley line, Summit is a wide street with parallel parking and narrow sidewalks. Belmont is even wider, with enough room to accommodate angled parking. Automobiles dominate these wide streets where few people own cars and residents want a higher and better use of the space. Due to the lack of greenery and permeable surface in the Summit-Belmont corridor, very little stormwater is infiltrated in this three block area.","In 2016, over 50 people came to a parking day installation on Summit Ave to reimagine the street.  The community members that stopped to talk expressed great enthusiasm for the greening and placemaking ideas presented. Capitol Hill Housing, through its Capitol Hill EcoDistrict Initiative is assessing the feasibility of these ideas in 2017. The EcoDistrict would like to work with a Your Voice Your Choise team to develop and implement a proof of concept project that would build momentum for a larger-scale effort to improve the social and physical environment in this neighborhood through either a depaving project or a green street designation. The street width and the prevalence of supportive property owners provide opportunities for narrowing the street on one or both sides to allow depavement, incorporation of green planting strips, and tree canopy. Other community priorities that could be achieved as proof of concept include sidewalk widening, sidewalk repair, curb ramp installation, painted curb bulb/sidewalks, rain garden or bioswale installation, or the creation of a small pavement park that provide social and environmental benefits.

Capitol Hill Housing and Bellwether Housing each have apartment buildings in this area, affordable to individuals and families earning less than 60% of the area median income. According to the 2010-2014 American Community Survey, people living in this part of Capitol Hill have the highest use rate of food stamps and some of the lowest incomes in the neighborhood. 21% of the people living in this area are living in poverty with an average median household income of just $35,965.   The distribution of green space throughout Capitol Hill reflects the distribution of wealth. The wealthier areas of the EcoDistrict have significantly more tree cover and greater access to neighborhood parks. This area has less tree canopy coverage than anywhere else in the EcoDistrict, according to a 2007 study by the City of Seattle, and residents who live in this area live more than 1/8 mile walk from the closest park. A 2015 study in the journal ‘Nature’ found that people who live in neighborhoods with a higher density of trees on their streets report significantly higher health perception and significantly less cardio-metabolic conditions controlling for socio-economic and demographic factors. Having 10 more trees in a city block, on average, improves health perception in ways comparable to an increase in annual personal income of $10,000, moving to a neighborhood with $10,000 higher median income or being 7 years younger. According to the City of Seattle’s Urban Forest Management Plan, trees “increase property values, calm traffic, reduce crime and improve the walkability of our neighborhoods.” No other part of Capitol Hill is in greater need of greening than this small forgotten corridor, and it could provide a restorative amenity for some of Capitol Hill’s lowest income and most vulnerable residents.

Unfortunately, the sidewalk that for more than 50 years was on the west side of Harvard Ave. E. north of the Lakeview Blvd. intersection was removed by the I-5 construction and was not replaced when I-5 opened in 1962.  This omission magnified the problem that for 300 feet to the north, the sidewalk on the east side of Harvard Ave. E. is far above the street, and very steeply so (precluding access between the street and sidewalk) and thus is reachable at its south end only via stairs near Lakeview Blvd.—and thus that sidewalk is inaccessible for anyone who has trouble with stairs, such as those with disabilities or who use baby strollers.  Only by re-establishing the sidewalk on the west side of Harvard Avenue E. will there again be a safe pedestrian route.      In bringing back the missing sidewalk on the west side of Harvard Avenue, the most urgent need is just north of Lakeview Blvd. for 300 feet to where the sidewalk on the east side of Harvard Avenue E. comes down to street level.

I would also like yellow “Residential Street speed limit 20mph” signs posted all over the place.

The meadow area of Carkeek Park Demonstration Gardens is soggy and occasionally experiences standing water.  This condition begins to develop in late October and runs through winter, and into early spring.  The source of this water appears to be the slope immediately to the east of the meadow.  On the slope, a small natural outlet is observed actively leaking water.  In addition to the outlet, the meadow is comprised of poorly-drained soil, which compounds the problem.    An existing trail of approximately 350 feet runs through this area, which is frequented by garden visitors, parents of Tiny Trees preschool children, Parks staff, and garden stewards.  In its present condition, the trail is interrupted by the standing water, slippery mud, and requires improvement.  The following materials are required for trail improvement:   2”x4” quarry spalls, 5/8” minus gravel, ¼” minus gravel.    Cost of these materials:   Quarry spalls:  $21.75/cuyd + 20 yds needed = $435  5/8” minus:      $40.00/cuyd + 20 yds = $800.00  ¼” minus:         $50.00/cuyd + 20 yds = $1,000.

Labor will be provided by volunteer groups.  Total cost for bog garden: $895  Total estimated cost for entire project (trail and bog garden): $6,130  ","Our ideas are: build a bog garden to capture and contain the water.  This bog would not need an outlet as it would be extensively planted with plants that survive in areas of standing water and can survive periods of drought, which this area experiences in mid to late summer months.  The dimensions of the bog garden would be 29 ft in length and 18 ft at the widest point; the deepest (middle) portion of the bog would be 3.5 feet.  In addition, we will improve the existing trail by creating a base of gravel to facilitate drainage, then elevating the trail slightly above the level of the bog garden to keep the trail dry year-round.

In sun and heat dugout covers also provide desired shade for the players.  The dugouts are also under-sized, being too narrow, and they do not comply with ADA standards.  In contrast, Soundview #3 and 4 ballfields are examples of renovated dugouts having a proper size to comply with the ADA and to accommodate full teams of up to 13 players and their gear.    NA2 also suffers from severe flooding conditions where there is excessive mud and large puddling just outside the first-base dugout every Spring.","Update the NA1 and NA2 dugouts to have an expanded size and covers according to the same design and standards as used on Soundview ballfield #3 (“SV3”) (upgraded back in 2008-09).  Improve drainage in the area outside the first-base dugout of NA2.    NA1 is being improved in February 2017 by Parks to complete preliminary steps required to support dugout expansion.  Parks is moving the existing retaining wall further west to create sufficient space behind the third-base dugout.

Of course, sidewalks are expensive and rare in our neighborhood.  My suggestion, to make walking both safer and more pleasant, would be to dedicate more of the road, particularly on side streets to walking space.  Of course, this will impact the current predominant use, parking cars.  Where sidewalks are not feasible could we not, at the very least, change some of the nose-in parking (which takes up nearly all the spare roadside) to parallel parking on one side of the roads?  As it is now, short, development required sidewalks are frequently STOPped by nose-in parked vehicles on the very next property, all perfectly legally.  The decision I usually make is to skip these short intrusions and walk, somewhat nervously, along the street's edge, mostly in on the street side of these nosed in vehicles.

Not Feasible,,,Not Feasible,Too expensive,17-344,,ADA trail improvements in Seward Park,"Suggestions for ADA accessible trails and pedestrian crosswalks in Seward Park were incorporated in the Comprehensive Trail Plan of May 2009, but most have not been carried out. ","Implement the elements of the Trail Plan that address ADA accessibility and pedestrian crossing safety. There are also other crosswalks needed in the park that were not within the scope of the  of the trail plan, which only dealt with interior trails and not roads.     For ADA accessibility, the Earthquake Scarp Trail has been graded for ADA standards on the north end, but it needs a barrier or marked turnaround so wheelchairs do not attempt to descend the south end that has stairs. This would be simple and very low cost. In the comprehensive trail plan, it was proposed to make the bald Eagle Trail and the main part of the Sqebeqsed Trail ADA compliant by doing some trail regrading, and putting in a crosswalk from the parking lot by picnic shelter #3 to the trailhead for the Bald Eagle and Lost lake Trails. The crosswalk would benefit the safety of all park users entering the forest at this point and help direct hikers to a  single entrance instead of the two parallel entrances that have developed. Alternatively, ADA access to the Upper Loop Trailhead for the Sqebeqsed Trail could be obtained if appropriate ADA parking were added by the trailhead or at the amphitheater.    Cross walks would also be helpful in other locations:  1)  where the Sqebeqsed Trail crosses the upper loop road from Picnic shelter #2 to the amphitheater  2) on either side of the Japanese Garden in the Entrance circle, connecting the path through the garden to the new torii site. The existing crosswalks at Juneau and Lake Washington Boulevard bypass the entrance to the garden, and most park users have no idea how to access the garden. This would be an excellent location for a culturally appropriate painted crosswalk, perhaps with stylized cherry blossoms.  3) at the bottom of the upper loop road by the parking lot by the Clay Studio. Pedestrians coming the the lower loop path are discharged into the parking lot with no clear direction for continuing, either to the sidewalk on the west side of the lot or to cross the road to the sidewalk on the east side of the upper loop road. A crosswalk and some direction out of the parking lot would improve safety here.

Many senior citizens right now have to stand outside in all sorts of weather conditions to catch the bus. A covered bench for the #106 bus on that street corner would make it much more safe for elderly clients (otherwise in bad weather they wait in the ACRS building and run out to catch the bus, risking tripping and falling). The next idea is to improve the lighting and visibility on S. Della Street, right near the parking lot for ACRS. There is no sidewalk on S. Della - it cuts off at a sharp corner and incline that cars rush through and can't anticipate pedestrians. Since there is no paved sidewalk, it gets muddy and becomes dangerous in rainy weather.

Presently there are few pedestrian or bicycle friendly approaches to the school that would lead parents to choose walking and biking to school over driving, and none that cross the arterial community divide of Lake Washington Blvd. However, there is one route that has the potential to become a safe bicycling and walking route to school for all students who live west of Lake Washington Blvd.  ","Implement the Hillside Drive Greenway that is in the approved 2014 City of Seattle Bicycle Master Plan as part of the citywide backbone of the all­-ages­-and­-abilities bicycle network.

Not Feasible,,,Not Feasible,Overbudget,17-429,,Sidewalk on Lakeview Blvd between E. Blaine and E. Howe streeets. ,"Lakeview Blvd. is a principal arterial that is just east of Interstate 5.  There are sidewalks on both sides of its full length with the sole exception of one block (340 feet) on the east side of Lakeview Blvd. between East Blaine Street and East Howe Street.  Blaine and Howe streets at this point are steep and exist only as heavily used public staircases (among the longest in Seattle) that connect the top of Capitol Hill (10th Avenue East) to the Lake Union area.      Between the E. Blaine and E. Howe Street stairs, a sidewalk is missing on the east side of Lakeview Blvd.  Its absence is a risk and barrier for many pedestrians who use this area for commuting, exercise, sight-seeing, or to reach homes, businesses, and nearby parks as well as to such areas as Melrose, South Lake Union, downtown, and the University District.  In all such cases, Lakeview Blvd. is a crucial link, and requires the sidewalk.      The sidewalk is especially needed by the thousands each week who use the E. Blaine and E. Howe Street public staircases that extend east from Lakeview Blvd. up Capitol Hill to 10th Avenue East, and west to Lake Union via the Park Department’s Colonnade public staircase under I-5 that follows the Blaine St. alignment.  Many people use the Blaine and Howe Street staircases not just for travel but as an exercise circuit. The lack of a sidewalk between the staircases is a dangerous barrier to this use and an attractive nuisance.    To traverse north-south this block of missing sidewalk, pedestrians currently face two equally perilous alternatives:  either walk in the roadway on the east side of Lakeview Blvd., or make two crossings of Lakeview Blvd. to and from the sidewalk on its west side.  In both cases, they are mixing with fast-moving traffic, including from the nearby I-5 northbound off-ramp.  It’s not only very inconvenient, but a tragedy waiting to happen.    SDOT has studied installing 340 feet of 6-foot wide sidewalk, concrete curb and gutter (planting strips would be omitted in order to minimize costs).  With or without the proposed sidewalk, a retaining wall may be needed, as the hillside continues to slump across the curb into the roadway, forcing pedestrians and bicyclists towards the center of the street.       To minimize the need for a retaining wall, the curb could be moved another six feet into the roadway in order to narrow Lakeview Blvd. and create a new sidewalk that would not be as close to the hillside.  However, moving the curb and sidewalk into the current roadway could expose pedestrians to motor vehicles jumping the curb, and the sidewalk would still be subject to landslides that are best dealt with by a retaining wall.     A sidewalk without a retaining wall is likely not sustainable either for landslide safety or for what is best for pedestrian safety and for preserving public parking along Lakeview Blvd.  Pedestrian funds should not bear the full cost of the retaining wall, as SDOT owes it to motorists to prevent a landslide into Lakeview Blvd.   ","As explained in (1) above, a sidewalk at this location is essential for pedestrian safety and to enable the many pedestrians who wish to use Lakeview Blvd. and the Blaine and Howe Street steps for travel or recreation.  ",,This block of Lakeview Blvd. is between E. Blaine and E. Howe streeets.

Not Feasible,,,Not Feasible,Too expensive and requires community involvement,17-431,,Sloped Pathway at I-5 Colonnade Open Space,"When in 2005 the Seattle Parks and Recreation Department opened the I-5 Colonnade Open Space, it did not provide an ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) compliant entry from Franklin Avenue E. on the park's central west side near E. Blaine Street.   The ADA-accessible switchback pathway that is accessible from Colonnade’s NW and NE entries effectively ends to the southwest at a dead end for wheelchair users.  Although this pathway continues southwest to the Blaine St. entry, its short continuation to the southwest is far too steep for anyone with a disability, and is uncomfortably steep for most pedestrians and bicyclists.       Also lacking in ADA accessibility, and uncomfortably steep for most pedestrians and bicyclists is the east-west maintenance road that provides a pathway to and from Colonnade’s E. Blaine St. entry on Colonnade’s west side.  This route is the only east or west access to Colonnade's granite gathering area and to the north end of the off-leash area.      This lack of disability access at a major entrance to a significant City park was identified as a priority for correction by the 2016 schematic long-range plan that was produced with Neighborhood Matching Funds in coordination with City agencies and the Washington State Department of Transportation.  This accessibility problem first came to the attention of the planning and design process as a result of concern expressed by a dog owner who is disabled and can’t reach the north end of the off-leash area.    To solve the ADA-accessibility gap just described (and without interfering with the WSDOT/Parks Dept. maintenance road), the 2016 schematic long-range plan envisions an ADA-accessible pathway whose gradual slope is achieved by extending into the area of redwood trees that is just west of the off-leash area, being slightly raised above the ground so as not to damage their roots.  All pedestrians would benefit from the easier slope and from the beauty amidst the redwoods, without getting wet feet.

Conceptual design is by civil engineer Micah Shapiro of Grindline Concrete Skatepark Design and Construction; and architect and construction management specialist Sean Kelly of  SHKS Architects.  The skatespot design envisions two bowls, two ledges, a hip (two ramps at a 90 degree angle from each other rising to a shared deck), a “manny pad” (a long low platform allowing skateboarders to make a small jumps where the level changes), and flatground.  The design takes advantage of how the southwest wall drops off down the hillside, proposing that the wall include bouldering (climbing) features.  Toward the southwest there would also be stairs.      The I-5 freeway would shelter the skatespot from precipitation.  Lighting (much of it recessed beneath the stairs and benches to create a striated appearance similar to the freeway I-beams above) would enable nighttime use—at present not an option for skateboarders unless at an expensive private skatepark.

Plagued with deferred maintenance, this once attractive green space became an “attractive nuisance.” This place is neither green nor inviting nor a gathering space for Pioneer Square’s residents and visitors to interact. The park needs a fresh approach in terms of design, management and programming so it can once again serve as an anchor to the neighborhood. Specifically, brick pathways are deteriorating, vehicles park along the only building frontage to the park effectively shrinking the size and feel of the park, a fence along the north side breaks the space apart even further, little sun permeates the space through the tree canopy in the summer, and tree roots are heaving. Nothing about this park invites or encourages people to stay. This funding would kickstart the greater effort to inject life into all of Pioneer Square’s parks and public spaces. ","In alignment with the Pioneer Square Parks and Gateways Concept Plan, we recommend some immediate fixes to improve the park; removing the fence along the north side of the park, disallowing parking along the south side of King County Courthouse, restricting the right of way for loading only, painting the right of way with a pattern to illustrate it as a pedestrian space, repairing brick pavers near benches and along pathways, replacing the 5 plastic garbage cans with the standard SPU garbage and recycling cans, replacing sidewalk where tree roots have caused heaving around two trees on the south side of the park, replacing the mossy American flag waving on the flag pole, and selectively removing two to three trees to allow more sunlight into the space.

The bus drops off at several points there but the sidewalk is usually overgrown with blackberry bushes and very narrow. It would benefit many to have that area be safer and nicer to walk along. Also, because the sidewalk is narrow and the traffic busy, the air pollution is unpleasant. If well chosen trees could be added that would be helpful. The openings between N 49th and 2nd Ave NW along that same stretch are too wide for pedestrians to cross safely. I've also seen a number of middle schoolers try to cross Market in that stretch. There are no traffic lights and so it is very unsafe. Additionally the view is lovely if you could stop and enjoy it. Currently, it's just too busy a road and the air is not very good, not to mention the space is tight.",Make the sidewalk more continuous along Market. Less large expanse of neighborhood access road between N 49th and 2nd Ave NW. Possibly add a street light for students to use to cross safely from one side of the street to the other. Overall clean up brush and make the sidewalk wider with a barrier to keep pedestrians safer from the fast traffic.

Streets all over Seattle are in need of fixing.  28th Ave so has so many pot holes that you can not drive around them.  When building projects are complete the streets remain a bumpy mess where they have been dug up for what ever reason and not put back in a good driving condition.   Cars left on the street for over two weeks and not moved should be towed away or ticketed if it can be driven.,My idea is to use some monies to repair the streets where they need to be.  Hopefully they will be repaired that they last for longer than a few months.  Some whole streets need to be repaved.   ,,28th and 29th ave so I know because I live here.  From Jackson to Dearborn.
